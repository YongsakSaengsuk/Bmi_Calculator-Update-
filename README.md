# BMI Calculator (v1)

A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application, recreated and enhanced to display BMI results with a graphical meter gauge. This project is hosted at: [BMI Calculator DEMO](https://yongsaksaengsuk.github.io/Bmi_Calculator_DEMO/).

## Features (v1)
- Input weight in kilograms (kg).

- **[syncfusion_flutter_gauges](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_gauges)** (version: `^28.1.39`) for the graphical meter gauge.

## Future Features
Planned improvements for future versions:
1. **English Language Support:** Add an option to switch between Thai and English languages.

3. **BMI History Tracking:** Store and display the user's previous BMI calculations.
4. **Health Recommendations:** Provide general health suggestions based on BMI categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
5. **Dark Mode:** Add support for dark and light themes to improve user experience.
6. **Customizable Gauge:** Allow users to customize the gauge's appearance (e.g., colors, labels).
